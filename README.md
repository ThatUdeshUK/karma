# Karma

Sync UGVLE assignment with Google Calender

## Setup

### Step 1 - Generate ```credentials.json```
A ```credentials.json``` file from a Google Cloud Platform project is needed to used the Calender API.

1. Create a new Google Cloud Platform project (https://console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate).
2. Goto APIs & Services > Credentials
3. Create a 'OAuth2 Client ID' from 'CREATE CREDENTIALS'
4. Select 'Desktop App' as the application type and enter a name for the credentials
5. Finish creation using 'CREATE'
6. Download the credentials and move it to the ```karma``` directory

> Note: ```Google Calender API``` should be enabled from the console's API library.

### Step 2 - Configure the environment

Use ```setup.py``` to create an environment for scripts to be run.

1. Change permissions of ```setup.sh```
```sh
sudo chmod 755 setup.sh
```

2. Run the ```setup.sh```
```sh
./setup.sh
```

### Step 3 - Configure run script
Run ```karma``` scripts using ```run.sh```.

1. Create ```run.sh```
```sh
cp run.sh.sample run.sh
```

2. Change ```<username>``` and ```<password>``` inside ```run.sh``` to UGVLE username and password respectively

3. Change permissions of ```run.sh```
```sh
sudo chmod 755 run.sh
```

4. Run the ```run.sh```
```sh
./run.sh
```

### Step 4 (Optional) - Setup a cron job

Setup up a cron job to run ```run.sh``` in intervals to automatically sync assignments with Google Calender.
